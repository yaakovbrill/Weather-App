# Weather App

## Description
The [Weather App](https://yaakovbrill.pythonanywhere.com/) tool lets users check real-time weather information for cities worldwide. Users can enter any city name, and the app uses the Google Maps API to determine its geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). With these coordinates, the app retrieves detailed weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The web interface allows users to select either a five-day summary forecast (with daily min/max temperatures) or a detailed 48-hour real-time forecast, providing temperature and wind data in 3-hour intervals. You can view the website at https://yaakovbrill.pythonanywhere.com/.
