# Weather App

## Description
The [Weather App](https://yaakovbrill.pythonanywhere.com/) tool allows users to check real-time weather information for any city in the world. Users can enter the name of any city, and the tool uses the Google Maps API to find the geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the city. These coordinates are then used to fetch weather details from the OpenWeatherMap API. The app provides a web interface where users can choose to view either a five-day summary forecast or a detailed 48-hour view of real-time weather data. You can view the website at https://yaakovbrill.pythonanywhere.com/.

## Languages & Tools
We used Python (with relevant APIs), MySQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS with PythonAnywhere hosting the application.
